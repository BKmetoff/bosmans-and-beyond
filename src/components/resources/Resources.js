		patron:
			'Henriëtte Bosmans (1895 - 1952) was a Dutch pianist and composer. She frequently performed with Concertgebouw Orchestra as a concert pianist with Willem Mengelberg as the conductor. Before the WWII, her career prospered as a pianist in The Netherlands, due to the cancellations of foreign musicians. Bosmans began studying music theory and composition with Jan Willem Kersbergen, then Willem Pijper and instrumentation with Cornelis Dopper. Bosmans first published work is as early as in 1917, when she was 23 years old. Her international breakthrough as a composer was in 1938, when Willem Noske (violin) played her music in Paris and Prague. Her career was blocked by the war, because she was now undesirable due to her partial-Jewish origin. After the war, she continued to compose and work closely with musicians such as Jo Vincent and Noémie Perugia. She composed until 1951, a year before her death. Her oeuvre of works includes many orchestral works, chamber music and many songs.',
		mission:
			'Our ever-changing world is reflected in music and art. Gender and race are one of the many important topics in our society today and we wish to be a part of the change. Our patron, Henriëtte Bosmans was celebrated for being one of the most successful pianists and composers in the Netherlands during her lifetime. We are fascinated by her life story; the difficulties she faced being part Jewish during the WWII and her struggle to gain recognition as a female composer. Unfortunately, today she is rarely performed, therefore we would like to honour her talent and dedication by performing her music.',
