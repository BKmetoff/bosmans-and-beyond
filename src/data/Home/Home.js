		'Henriëtte Bosmans (1895 - 1952) was a Dutch pianist and composer. She frequently performed with Concertgebouw Orchestra as a concert pianist with Willem Mengelberg as the conductor. Before the WWII, her career prospered as a pianist in The Netherlands, due to the cancellations of foreign musicians. Bosmans began studying music theory and composition with Jan Willem Kersbergen, then Willem Pijper and instrumentation with Cornelis Dopper. Bosmans first published work is as early as in 1917, when she was 23 years old. Her international breakthrough as a composer was in 1938, when Willem Noske (violin) played her music in Paris and Prague. Her career was blocked by the war, because she was now undesirable due to her partial-Jewish origin. After the war, she continued to compose and work closely with musicians such as Jo Vincent and Noémie Perugia. She composed until 1951, a year before her death. Her oeuvre of works includes many orchestral works, chamber music and many songs.',

	[mapSectionToCopy.MISSION]:
		"Bosmans & Beyond offers various programs of unusually inclusive music choices. There is a volume of music that was excluded from musical canon not because of its quality, but based on composers' gender, race, political view, etc. For each concert, we invite you to listen to the well-known classics, mixed with pieces that probably have never had a chance to be heard. This alternative musical point of view might introduce us all to something unique and beautiful.",
